I am an experienced developer in many web technologies. My initial training emphasizes the notions of development quality and application security. My speciality is the ability to work \textbf{on large, very complex applications whose technologies need to be updated}.
Consequently, I am the perfect person to work in companies with very different technological portfolios, both old and new, and whose objective is to manage technical debt and to modernise existing systems with the newest technologies.

In addition to my architectural skills, I am a skilled Java/Javascript/Typescript developer.

Finally, I gladly and attentively coach the most junior developers and train them to become the elite developers of tomorrow.
